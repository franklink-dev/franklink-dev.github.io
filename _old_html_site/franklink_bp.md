## Executive Summary

### Product
Franklink is an AI-powered career co-pilot that transforms how university students achieve their career goals. Unlike generic job boards and networking sites, Franklink provides personalized, step-by-step plans that help students become top candidates for their target roles. By aggregating and recommending the most relevant opportunities—events, clubs, hackathons, and more—and offering data-driven, real-time guidance, Franklink directly addresses the fragmentation and inefficiency students face.

### Problem Statement
Career opportunities for students are scattered and fragmented across multiple disconnected platforms, making them hard to discover. According to our survey of 50 students at UPenn and UC Berkeley, 98% struggle to track opportunities hidden in portals, newsletters, and club announcements. This fragmentation forces 92% of students to spend over two hours a week searching, with 66% spending more than five hours—time lost to administrative work instead of actual career building. Meanwhile, 84% feel university career services provide only generic advice, not personalized, strategic guidance, due to student-to-advisor ratios often exceeding 1,200-to-1.

### Solution: Franklink
Franklink provides AI-powered, conversational guidance that personalizes the entire career journey for each student. Drawing from fragmented resources, the platform intelligently identifies and recommends the most valuable events, organizations, and actionable steps—tailoring guidance in real time and adjusting strategies as students progress, overcome obstacles, and achieve milestones on their path to career success.

### Customers
Franklink's core customers are undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, we target institutions like the University of Pennsylvania and UC Berkeley, where student research has demonstrated an urgent need and demand for a guided, AI-powered co-pilot.

## Market Research

### Industry
University career services sit at the crossroads of edtech, professional networking, and labor market access, but the current system is inefficient. In the U.S. alone, there are 19M undergraduates and 3M graduate students, all under pressure to secure internships and jobs in highly competitive industries. Yet career resources remain fragmented across job boards, departmental newsletters, student clubs, and alumni offices, leaving students overwhelmed.

Traditional platforms like LinkedIn and Handshake provide broad access to job listings, but they do not provide students with resources to prepare for those jobs. Moreover, career advisors often serve 1,200–3,000 students each, making personalized guidance essentially impossible. With limited funding and staff, offices can only provide generic services—résumé workshops, broad career fairs—rather than tailored strategies for individual students.

Universities are under increasing pressure to improve placement outcomes, as employment rates directly influence rankings, enrollment, and alumni giving. This creates strong institutional demand for tools that provide measurable improvements in student success and alumni engagement.

### Customers

#### Primary Users – Students
Undergraduate and graduate students seeking internships, jobs, or research roles.

#### Secondary Customers – Universities
Career services offices and university administrators under pressure to improve job placement and alumni engagement, both of which directly influence rankings, enrollment, and donor support. Franklink provides them with enterprise dashboards that show placement analytics, student engagement with resources, and alumni interaction data—delivering measurable ROI on career services.

Franklink specifically targets large universities such as the University of Pennsylvania (21,000 students) and UC Berkeley (45,000 students) as pilot institutions.

### Franklink's Moat
Franklink's moat is strengthened by a unique, community-driven data collection system that leverages user contributions and creates a sustainable loop of value creation. Users are actively rewarded with Franklink usage tokens for uploading new and validated opportunities around them—such as club application links, career fair event links, and workshop registration links—that have not yet appeared in the platform's database. This incentivized approach enables Franklink to aggregate the latest, most relevant opportunities unavailable elsewhere. As the number of uploaded resources grows, the platform's AI can deliver even more targeted and personalized recommendations, drawing in more users and accelerating the cycle. This continuous data enrichment, powered by user participation and token rewards, makes Franklink's ecosystem increasingly robust, defensible, and difficult for competitors to replicate.

### Regulations
Franklink complies with FERPA and GDPR standards, ensuring secure handling of student and alumni data. All data integrations are conducted via API with user consent.

### Intellectual Property Rights
FrankLink's competitive advantage is anchored in its proprietary technology, curated datasets, and brand identity. The company protects and expands its intellectual property through trade secret practices, contractual agreements, copyright protections, and planned patent filings.

The core career recommendation engine, which ranks and sequences resources into personalized Path Builders, is proprietary and maintained as a trade secret. FrankLink intends to pursue patent protection for novel aspects of this system, including the hybrid ranking and sequence optimization methodology as well as the explainable recommendation interface.

The datasets generated by FrankLink, which aggregate and normalize information from campus calendars, provider catalogs, project repositories, and pilot outcomes, are proprietary compilations. These datasets are protected under copyright and database rights, and the company enforces strict licensing and user-consent protocols to comply with FERPA, GDPR, and other privacy laws while ensuring exclusive use of aggregated insights.

All source code, APIs, and workflow orchestration systems are proprietary to FrankLink and protected under copyright law. Enterprise customers access these systems only through licensing agreements, and no transfer of ownership occurs.

The FrankLink name, logo, and visual identity represent core brand assets. These marks will be protected through trademark registration in key markets as the company scales.

Finally, FrankLink requires all employees, contractors, mentors, and partners to sign confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements. These agreements ensure that all innovations, code, and data created in connection with FrankLink remain the sole property of the company.

## Marketing & Sales

Franklink's go-to-market strategy centers on university campuses. We are going to hire passionate students from additional universities to localize outreach and create a presence at major collegiate events, fairs, and clubs. These campus representatives will spearhead tailored workshops, host info sessions, and activate word-of-mouth growth within their respective student bodies.

To create massive social media momentum, Franklink will produce student-led content campaigns—such as behind-the-scenes "career journey" stories, opportunity spotlights, and viral challenges—across platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Discord. Real success stories and testimonials will fuel digital advocacy, turning early adopters into evangelists.

On the sales side, Franklink will pursue university partnerships, collaborating with career centers and student organizations to integrate the platform into institutional support systems and increase student engagement at scale. This multi-channel approach—combining trusted peer influence, highly-targeted social media, and institutional buy-in—will drive both rapid user growth and long-term retention.
