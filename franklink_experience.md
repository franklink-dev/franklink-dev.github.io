# FrankLink: Complete User Experience Workflow

## Complete User Journey: Sarah's Story
### From CS Student to Product Manager at Uber

---

## Phase 1: First Interaction & Onboarding

### Day 1 - Initial Discovery

**Sarah:** Hi! I'm looking for opportunities to break into product management

**FrankLink:** Welcome! I'd love to help you find the perfect PM opportunities. Let me ask a few quick questions to personalize your journey:

1. What year are you in? (Sophomore/Junior/Senior)
2. What's your technical background? (CS/Business/Other)
3. Any prior PM experience? (Internships/Projects/None)
4. Time availability? (Few hours/week, Weekends, Full commitment)

**Sarah:** Junior, CS major, no PM experience yet, can dedicate weekends

**FrankLink:** Perfect! Based on your profile, I've found 5 great starting points for aspiring PMs with technical backgrounds:

🎯 **PM Fellowship Info Session** - Tomorrow, 6 PM
> Why this matters: Google PM is hosting. They specifically look for CS students transitioning to PM. Previous attendees had 40% interview success rate.
> [Register] [Save for later] [Tell me more]

💡 **Product Buds Hackathon** - Feb 15-17
> Why this matters: Build a product in 48hrs with designers & engineers. Winners get mentorship from Stripe PMs. Perfect for your first PM portfolio piece.
> [Register] [Prerequisites] [Find a team]

👥 **Campus Product Management Club** - Meets Wednesdays
> Why this matters: Run by ex-Meta PM. Weekly case studies + mock interviews. 70% of active members land PM internships.
> [Join waitlist] [See upcoming events]

🏢 **Microsoft PM Career Fair Booth** - Feb 20
> Why this matters: They're specifically recruiting junior PMs for summer internships. Bring your resume - they do on-spot screening.
> [Add to calendar] [Prep resources]

📚 **Product School Free Workshop: "CS to PM Transition"** - Feb 25
> Why this matters: Addresses exactly your background. Covers how to leverage technical skills in PM interviews.
> [Register] [See prerequisites]

Would you like me to explain any of these in detail, or should we explore different types of opportunities?

## Phase 2: Exploration & Refinement

### Day 3 - Deeper Dive & Concerns

**Sarah:** The hackathon sounds interesting but I've never done product work. Will I be out of place?

**FrankLink:** Great question! The Product Buds Hackathon is actually designed for beginners. Here's what makes it perfect for you:

📚 **Beginner-Friendly Structure:**
- Day 1 morning: 3-hour PM bootcamp covering user research, PRDs, prioritization
- Pre-formed teams available (no need to find teammates)
- Mentors assigned to each team
- Judged on process, not just outcome

✨ **Similar Success Stories:**
Last year, Jamie Chen (also CS junior, no PM experience) participated and:
- Won "Best User Research" award
- Used the project in 5 PM interviews
- Landed Uber APM internship

📖 **Prep Resources I Found:**
- 3-day prep guide from past winners
- YouTube: "My first PM hackathon" (15 min)
- Discord group of 20+ first-timers forming teams

Should I:
1. Sign you up and send the prep materials?
2. Connect you with last year's participants?
3. Find an alternative lower-commitment opportunity first?

**Sarah:** Let's do it! Sign me up and send the prep materials.

**FrankLink:** ✅ Registered! I've sent confirmation to your email with:
- Prep guide PDF
- Discord invite link
- Calendar invite with reminder 3 days before

💡 **Pro tip:** Since you're interested in hackathons, there's also "Productathon 2024" on March 10 - smaller, more focused on B2B products. Want me to keep you posted about similar events?

**Sarah:** Yes, definitely keep me updated on similar opportunities!

## Phase 3: Proactive Engagement

### Week 2 - Intelligent Check-in

**FrankLink:** Hey Sarah! Quick update on your PM journey:

📊 **Your Progress:**
- ✅ Attended: PM Fellowship Info Session
- 📅 Upcoming: Product Buds Hackathon (in 5 days!)
- 🆕 New this week: 3 opportunities matching your interests

🔥 **Time-Sensitive Opportunity:**
Uber APM Internship just opened applications (closes in 72 hours!)
> Why this matters: They loved Product Buds winners last year. Since you're participating, you'll have perfect timing for a strong application.
> [Start application] [Save for later]

📈 **Based on your interests:**
Since you engaged with hackathon content, you might like:
- Build Weekend: Smaller 24-hour product sprint this Saturday
- PM Case Competition: Similar format but focused on strategy

🎯 **Peer Benchmark:**
Other CS juniors pursuing PM have typically engaged with 3-4 opportunities by now. You're on track with 2. Most successful transitions involved:
- 1 hackathon ✅ (you're doing this!)
- 1 ongoing club/fellowship
- 2-3 networking events
- 1 project for portfolio

Want suggestions for the missing pieces?

**Sarah:** Yes, what networking events should I prioritize?

**FrankLink:** Based on your profile and upcoming hackathon, here are the best networking opportunities:

🌟 **High Priority (This Month):**

**1. Product Manager Coffee Chats** - Every Thursday, 5 PM
> Why perfect for you: Informal setting, less intimidating than formal networking. Host (Alex Park) loves helping CS students. Small groups (8-10 people).
> Match score: 95%
> [RSVP for this week]

**2. Women in Product Panel** - Feb 28
> Why perfect for you: 3 panelists transitioned from engineering. Q&A focused on career switches. Usually leads to mentor connections.
> Match score: 90%
> [Register] [See panelists]

**3. Startup Product Meetup** - Mar 5
> Why perfect for you: Attendees value technical skills more. Many early-stage startups looking for technical PMs. More hands-on discussions.
> Match score: 85%
> [Add to calendar]

💡 **Smart Strategy:**
After your hackathon (Feb 17), you'll have a great talking point. I suggest attending the Feb 22 Coffee Chat to share your fresh experience - it's a great conversation starter!

Want me to:
- Set reminders for these events?
- Send you networking tips for CS students?
- Find virtual alternatives if you can't attend in person?

## Phase 4: Post-Event Momentum

### Week 3 - Leveraging Success

**Sarah:** Just finished the hackathon! We got 2nd place. What should I do next to keep momentum?

**FrankLink:** Congratulations on 2nd place! 🎉 That's huge for your first hackathon. Let's capitalize on this momentum:

📌 **Immediate Actions (This Week):**

📝 **LinkedIn PM Networking Mixer** - Thursday
> Why now: You have a fresh talking point! "Just won 2nd at Product Buds" opens doors. 12 PMs from top companies attending.
> [RSVP] [Talking points generator]

✍️ **Document Your Win** - By Friday
Create a case study while it's fresh. I can help you structure it:
- Problem you solved
- Your process (user research, prioritization)

- Results and learnings
> [Case study template] [Examples from past winners]

🎯 **Next 2 Weeks - Portfolio Building:**

💼 **Write for ProductCases.com**

> Why you: Your 2nd place finish makes you credible
> [Pitch template] [Writing guidelines]

🏆 **Apply to PM Fellowship Programs**
Your hackathon win significantly boosts your chances:

Want me to adjust this based on your spring schedule?

**Sarah:** This is perfect! Can you help me prepare for the networking mixer?

## Phase 5: Interview Preparation

### Month 3 - Addressing Weaknesses

**Sarah:** I'm struggling with PM interviews. Keep failing the product sense questions.

**FrankLink:** I see the challenge. Let's fix this systematically. Based on your profile (strong technical, weaker business sense), here's a targeted plan:

🎯 **Immediate Practice (This Week):**

**Mock Interview Circle** - Tonight 8 PM
> Why perfect timing: John Park is mock interviewing - he failed 5 PM interviews before landing at Google. He specifically helps CS students with product sense.
> Your prep: Review his framework doc (sending now)
> [Join session] [John's background]

**PM Study Buddy Match**
I found 3 CS students also struggling with product sense:
- Kelly: Failed Meta interview last week (can share specific questions)
- Ryan: Preparing for Microsoft final round (has prep materials)
- Dev: Similar background, just landed Uber offer (can share what worked)
> [Start group chat] [Schedule session]

📚 **Structured Learning (Next 2 Weeks):**

**Product Sense Intensive Workshop** - Mar 20-22
> Match score: 95% - Specifically for technical students, uses coding analogies to explain business concepts. Small group (max 12).
> Why this works: 85% of CS attendees pass their next product sense interview
> [Register - 3 spots left]

**Daily Practice Plan:**
- Morning (15 min): One product case with solution
- Lunch (10 min): Analyze one product's business model
- Evening (20 min): Mock interview with study buddy
> [Case database] [Business model library]

🔍 **Hidden Resources:**

**Career Center Secret:**
They have a "failed interview debrief" service - not advertised but free. The counselor (Emma) is ex-Amazon PM.
> Best part: She has actual PM interview rubrics from FAANG companies
> [Book slot with Emma]

**Alumni Network Hack:**
Three alumni PMs offer "coffee chats" but actually do mock interviews if you ask. They prefer helping students who've shown effort (your hackathon counts!):
- Tom Liu (Google PM)
- Sarah Kim (Meta PM)
- Jason Wu (Apple PM)
> [How to reach out templates]

💡 **What's Actually Happening:**
Based on 50+ CS students I've helped:
- Technical students over-complicate product sense
- You're likely better than you think
- The fix usually takes 2-3 weeks of focused practice

**Common mistakes you might be making:**
1. Jumping to technical solutions too quickly
2. Not considering business constraints
3. Missing user empathy component

Want me to:
- Send you the "CS to PM Interview Decoder" guide?
- Schedule daily case problems for next 2 weeks?
- Connect you with Dev who just succeeded?

**Sarah:** Yes to all! Especially want to connect with Dev.
